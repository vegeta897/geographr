start out as just a lone journeyman

travelling between pixels takes a while.. long enough that you can do other activities while travelling

need food/water to survive. hunt, forage, etc. full stats skills and inventory system like an RPG
    - if run out of food/water while travelling, stop and wait for player input
    
fog of war - visibility based on elevation.

weather? moves across map in bands, server-controlled
    
each pixel has a temperature that gets updated every X minutes, seed-based, influenced by elevation and weather

find random native camps that have seed-generated desire levels for different goods/resources
    set up trade routes (or move the goods yourself at first) between 2 camps by hiring wagons
    either buy from a camp and sell in another, or carry out a trade, in which you could run off with the goods
        if wanted by a camp, every move has a chance of being found by camp rangers, based on proximity
        
    goods/resource ideas:       value per weight    abundance
